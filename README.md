# Student-Result-Management-System
This project “Student Result Management System” provides us a simple interface for maintainance of student's result information.
It can be used by educational institutes or colleges to maintain the records of students easily. 
Achieving this objective is difficult using a manual system as the information is scattered, and collecting relevant information may be very time consuming. 
All these problems are solved using this project.

**NOTE***
The format of the csv file to be used has been provided.
If any changes are made to the column names then code needs to be modified accordingly.
Save the CSV file at the same location as that of the Python file.
Thanks!
